  Check, if the systemd system state reports running and therefore the system is sound from systemd's point of view
remediation: |
  ## Abstract
  Check, if the systemd system state reported by `systemctl is-system-running` is **running**.
  Even that the systemd system state does not directly affect saptune other systemd services - especially the SAP related services - may be suffer from a **NOT** running state.
  If the systemd system state is **running**, the check is passing.
  If the systemd system state is **initializing** or **starting** or **maintenance** or **stopping**, the check will report a warning.
  And if the systemd system state is **degraded** or **offline** or **unknown**, the check will report a critical error.

  ## Remediation
  Check the man page of **systemctl** to get a detailed explanation, what the reported state means. A `systemctl list-units --failed` list failed services and can assist to track down the cause.
