  /etc/hosts file contains all the cluster nodes

  ## Abstract
  If hostnames are used in the cluster configuration, it's essential to have a reliable hostname resolution.
  The cluster communication fails if the names are unavailable, and that can lead to cluster failover delays.

  The benefit of using /etc/hosts is that your cluster becomes independent of the DNS, which could be a single
  point of failure too.

  Name resolution of cluster nodes and virtual IPs is recommended to be local.

  ## Remedation
  Specify IP addresses of all cluster nodes in the /etc/hosts.
