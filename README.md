# Trento Checks

Trento Checks are the way Trento provides continous infractructure compliance.

They are implemented with a declarative, YAML-based DSL aiming at expressing some expectations on the configuration of a target system, or a group of target systems.

The Checks are then executed by our Trento checks engine, [Wanda](https://github.com/trento-project/wanda).

## Usage

The Checks code was originally hosted together with Wanda itself and only later decoupled in this repository, so most of the related documentation will remain [there](https://github.com/trento-project/wanda/blob/main/guides/) until migrated somewhere else (if ever).

You can start learning more by consulting the [specification document](https://github.com/trento-project/wanda/blob/main/guides/specification.md).
